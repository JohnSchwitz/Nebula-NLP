        Princess Hazel peered out the window of her bedroom in the palace, watching as dusk fell over the Kingdom of the Dragons. At only 5 years old, she felt a yearning for adventure that burned brighter than even the fading sunset.
        Little did she know, her life was about to be turned upside down. As night blanketed the kingdom, terrible screams echoed from downstairs – it was her mother, Queen Micky. Hazel raced down the marble halls and what she saw terrified her…
        Jackson's bedroom door was flung open wide, clothes and belongings strewn violently about the room. In the center of the chaos, a crude ransom note lay crumpled. Jackson had been kidnapped. By who and why was still a mystery. All Hazel knew was that her beloved brother was missing, snatched away in the night.
        <br><br>
        As the palace guards rushed about, Hazel felt her tiny body trembling with determination. She could not simply wait for the search to play out. She had to take matters into her own hands. After stuffing a bag with supplies, Hazel carefully made her way down to the stables under the palace.
        Her eyes landed on her pony, Bubbles, who whinnied softly as the princess entered. Hazel wasted no time throwing a saddle onto Bubbles' back. "We ride at once, my friend," she whispered. "We cannot rest until Jackson is home again."
        <br><br>
        With a determined nod, Hazel swung herself up onto Bubbles' saddle. Digging her heels into the pony's flanks, she steered them toward the hidden tunnel that would lead outside under cover of night. Hazel gripped the reins tightly, her jaw set. She would not let fear override her bravery – not while her brother's life was in peril.
        Unbeknownst to Hazel, Prince Morbid had followed silently behind. As she glanced around outside, trying to get her bearings, his voice hissed from the shadows. "You won't last a day out there, Princess." There he stood, arms folded. "I'm coming with you whether you like it or not."
        <br><br>
        His arrogant demeanor grated on Hazel's nerves, but she realized the blustering prince might be helpful. Begrudgingly, she gave a curt nod.
        And with that, the unlikely duo set off into the dark unknown, motivated by two very different goals – one to find her kidnapped kin, and the other by whatever shadowy motive lay beneath his unnerving smile. They weren't alone for long however…
        There, trotting out from the passage, were Hazel's beloved pets – the brave orange cat Misty Mae and her faithful gray tuxedo sister Blue. Hazel's face beamed as the felines rushed to her side, happy to have their fierce but calming presence along.
        <br><br>
        "Fascinating little beasts," Morbid mused. "But I'll be curious to see how useful they prove against dragonfire."
        The desolate Dragon Lands seemed to stretch on endlessly. But Misty Mae's bravery was put to the test when a massive rust-colored dragon came thundering over the rise, ready to strike.
        To Hazel's amazement, Misty Mae let out a fearsome yowl and stood defiantly against the beast. "Not on your life, overgrown handbag!" she snarled. "This princess isn't getting so much as a smudge while I'm around."
        <br><br>
        In a shocking twist, the dragon actually recoiled from the tiny cat, seeming to recognize Misty Mae as a terrifying "rexgrema" before fleeing in terror.
        Buoyed by her courageous companion's display, Hazel pressed ahead with new determination. After overcoming other obstacles, they finally laid eyes on a foreboding obsidian castle – where Jackson had to be held hostage.
        Though hesitant, Morbid brazenly strode toward the gate and knocked. To everyone's surprise, it creaked open…revealing a scrawny dragon no bigger than a malnourished pony.
        <br><br>
        "Oh! Are you the rescue party too?" the tiny dragon squeaked. "Thank goodness, I've been dreadfully lonesome!"
        Utterly baffled, Hazel turned to Morbid, whose sheepish look said it all – he had fabricated Jackson's "kidnapping" as an elaborate ruse! After owning up, the prince seemed impressed by Hazel's bravery.
        Feigning annoyance, Hazel playfully decreed that Morbid owed her "kitchen brownie duty" as penance. As they laughed, their host – a dragon named Cedric – invited everyone in for chamomile.
        <br><br>
        Exchanging a shrug, Hazel and her friends followed the affable little dragon into his quirky castle dominion. After all, she had just been on an epic adventure – so it was time to celebrate with tea!
